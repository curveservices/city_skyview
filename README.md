## Overview

This assignment is part of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> new <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/"> Responsive Web Design</a> curricular. 

This is a browser based skyview created with CSS and HTML. The project was more of a walk through assignment rather than free to code. This gave me a chance to practice Flex-box and a whole load of CSS.

## Provided Assets

## Objectives 

1. create a sky view 
2. style it both in day and night using @media
